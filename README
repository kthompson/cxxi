Known issues:

Function pointers do not work.

The generator does not store the mangled names of the c++ methods in the bindings, instead the cxxi library calculates the mangle name at run time. However the mangle name calculation in cxxi is incomplete and does not handle delegates which translate to function pointers in c++ world.
